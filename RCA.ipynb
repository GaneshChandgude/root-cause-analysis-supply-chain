        "        ------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "        CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:\n",
        "\n",
        "        1. Understand User Intent\n",
        "          - The user input may be:\n",
        "            • a greeting or help request (e.g., \"hi\", \"hello\", \"help\")\n",
        "            • a general question\n",
        "            • a root cause analysis or supply chain investigation\n",
        "          - Do not assume the input is analytical.\n",
        "\n",
        "        2. Decide the Level of Depth Required\n",
        "          - If the input can be addressed with a simple explanation or response,\n",
        "            prefer a lightweight approach.\n",
        "          - If the input requires investigation, reasoning, or analysis,\n",
        "            proceed with deep research behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "        3. Create an Internal Plan\n",
        "          - Before calling any tool, determine:\n",
        "            • what information is missing\n",
        "            • what needs to be discovered or generated\n",
        "            • whether memory or prior context is relevant\n",
        "          - The plan does not need to be shown unless required by a tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "        4. Execute Using Tools\n",
        "          - Use the **todo's** tools to carry out the plan.\n",
        "          - Choose tools based on their descriptions, not their names.\n",
        "          - You may call multiple tools if necessary.\n",
        "          - Always prefer the minimal set of tool calls needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "        5. RCA-Specific Behavior (when applicable)\n",
        "          - When the task involves diagnosing causes of a problem:\n",
        "            • avoid jumping to conclusions\n",
        "            • favor hypothesis generation before validation\n",
        "            • rely on state, memory, and evidence\n",
        "\n",
        "        ------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "        IMPORTANT RULES:\n",
        "\n",
        "        - Do not hard-code assumptions about tool availability.\n",
        "        - Do not invent tools or capabilities.\n",
        "        - Do not answer complex questions directly in free text\n",
        "          if an appropriate tool exists.\n",
        "        - Be robust to vague, short, or conversational user inputs.\n",
        "        - Think first, then act through tools.\n",

            "\n",
            "Executive Summary:\n",
            "Stores experienced stockouts primarily due to unexpectedly high demand driven by a promotional event, combined with delays in inventory replenishment and disruptions in supply chain operations. Uneven stock allocation across stores and additional stock shrinkage further exacerbated shortages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Primary Root Causes:\n",
            "- Unexpectedly high demand exceeding forecasted sales caused by promotional activities.\n",
            "- Delays and disruptions in inventory replenishment and shipments leading to stock shortages.\n",
            "- Inefficient distribution and allocation resulting in uneven stock levels across stores.\n",
            "- Supply chain disruptions affecting timely product availability.\n",
            "\n",
            "Supporting Evidence:\n",
            "- Sales data showed daily sales surged from an average of 2-6 units per store before the promotion to 15-55 units during the promotional period (May 1 to May 7, 2024).\n",
            "- Inventory data revealed replenishment shipments to all stores were delayed by 2 days during the promotion.\n",
            "- An emergency transfer of 50 units from one store to another highlighted uneven stock distribution.\n",
            "- Stock shrinkage of 12 units was recorded at one store during the promotional period.\n",
            "- No evidence of point-of-sale or inventory system errors was found.\n",
            "\n",
            "Contributing Factors:\n",
            "- Promotional pricing and marketing campaigns driving sudden spikes in demand.\n",
            "- Stock mismanagement and shrinkage at the store level.\n",
            "- Operational strain impacting inventory visibility during periods of delayed replenishment and emergency stock transfers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Key Data Points:\n",
            "- Promotion period: May 1 to May 7, 2024.\n",
            "- Sales volume during promotion ranged from 116 to 192 units per store.\n",
            "- Replenishment shipment delays of 2 days across all stores.\n",
            "- Emergency stock transfer of 50 units between stores.\n",
            "- Recorded shrinkage of 12 units at one store.\n",
            "\n",
            "Timeline of Events:\n",
            "- May 1, 2024: Promotion launched; daily sales surged significantly.\n",
            "- May 1, 2024: Emergency stock transfer of 50 units between stores.\n",
            "- May 3, 2024: Replenishment shipments delayed by 2 days.\n",
            "- May 4, 2024: Shrinkage adjustment of 12 units recorded.\n",
            "- May 7, 2024: Promotion ended.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recommendations:\n",
            "- Improve demand forecasting models to better anticipate promotional demand spikes.\n",
            "- Enhance supply chain processes to minimize replenishment delays and establish contingency plans for promotional periods.\n",
            "- Optimize stock allocation and distribution to ensure balanced inventory across stores before promotions.\n",
            "- Implement tighter controls and monitoring to reduce shrinkage during high-demand periods.\n",
            "- Strengthen inventory visibility and operational coordination during promotions for proactive stock management.\n",
            "\n",
            "Final Conclusion:\n",
            "The stockouts experienced by stores during the promotional period were driven by a combination of unexpectedly high demand and supply chain challenges, including replenishment delays and uneven stock distribution. Addressing these root causes with improved forecasting, supply chain resilience, and inventory management practices will help prevent similar issues in future promotions.\n",

Uneven stock allocation across stores and additional stock shrinkage further exacerbated shortages.\\n\\nPrimary Root Causes:\\n- Unexpectedly high demand exceeding forecasted sales caused by promotional activities.\\n- Delays and disruptions in inventory replenishment and shipments leading to stock shortages.\\n- Inefficient distribution and allocation resulting in uneven stock levels across stores.\\n- Supply chain disruptions affecting timely product availability.\\n\\nSupporting Evidence:\\n- Sales data showed daily sales surged from an average of 2-6 units per store before the promotion to 15-55 units during the promotional period (May 1 to May 7, 2024).\\n- Inventory data revealed replenishment shipments to all stores were delayed by 2 days during the promotion.\\n- An emergency transfer of 50 units from one store to another highlighted uneven stock distribution.\\n- Stock shrinkage of 12 units was recorded at one store during the promotional period.\\n- No evidence of point-of-sale or inventory system errors was found.\\n\\nContributing Factors:\\n- Promotional pricing and marketing campaigns driving sudden spikes in demand.\\n- Stock mismanagement and shrinkage at the store level.\\n- Operational strain impacting inventory visibility during periods of delayed replenishment and emergency stock transfers.\\n\\nKey Data Points:\\n- Promotion period: May 1 to May 7, 2024.\\n- Sales volume during promotion ranged from 116 to 192 units per store.\\n- Replenishment shipment delays of 2 days across all stores.\\n- Emergency stock transfer of 50 units between stores.\\n- Recorded shrinkage of 12 units at one store.\\n\\nTimeline of Events:\\n- May 1, 2024: Promotion launched; daily sales surged significantly.\\n- May 1, 2024: Emergency stock transfer of 50 units between stores.\\n- May 3, 2024: Replenishment shipments delayed by 2 days.\\n- May 4, 2024: Shrinkage adjustment of 12 units recorded.\\n- May 7, 2024: Promotion ended.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n- Improve demand forecasting models to better anticipate promotional demand spikes.\\n- Enhance supply chain processes to minimize replenishment delays and establish contingency plans for promotional periods.\\n- Optimize stock allocation and distribution to ensure balanced inventory across stores before promotions.\\n- Implement tighter controls and monitoring to reduce shrinkage during high-demand periods.\\n- Strengthen inventory visibility and operational coordination during promotions for proactive stock management.\\n\\nFinal Conclusion:\\nThe stockouts experienced by stores during the promotional period were driven by a combination of unexpectedly high demand and supply chain challenges, including replenishment delays and uneven stock distribution. Addressing these root causes with improved forecasting, supply chain resilience, and inventory management practices will help prevent similar issues in future promotions.\"}\n",
