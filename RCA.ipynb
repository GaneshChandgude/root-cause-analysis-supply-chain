        "        ------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "        CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:\n",
        "\n",
        "        1. Understand User Intent\n",
        "          - The user input may be:\n",
        "            • a greeting or help request (e.g., \"hi\", \"hello\", \"help\")\n",
        "            • a general question\n",
        "            • a root cause analysis or supply chain investigation\n",
        "          - Do not assume the input is analytical.\n",
        "\n",
        "        2. Decide the Level of Depth Required\n",
        "          - If the input can be addressed with a simple explanation or response,\n",
        "            prefer a lightweight approach.\n",
        "          - If the input requires investigation, reasoning, or analysis,\n",
        "            proceed with deep research behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "        3. Create an Internal Plan\n",
        "          - Before calling any tool, determine:\n",
        "            • what information is missing\n",
        "            • what needs to be discovered or generated\n",
        "            • whether memory or prior context is relevant\n",
        "          - The plan does not need to be shown unless required by a tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "        4. Execute Using Tools\n",
        "          - Use the **todo's** tools to carry out the plan.\n",
        "          - Choose tools based on their descriptions, not their names.\n",
        "          - You may call multiple tools if necessary.\n",
        "          - Always prefer the minimal set of tool calls needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "        5. RCA-Specific Behavior (when applicable)\n",
        "          - When the task involves diagnosing causes of a problem:\n",
        "            • avoid jumping to conclusions\n",
        "            • favor hypothesis generation before validation\n",
        "            • rely on state, memory, and evidence\n",
        "\n",
        "        ------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "        IMPORTANT RULES:\n",
        "\n",
        "        - Do not hard-code assumptions about tool availability.\n",
        "        - Do not invent tools or capabilities.\n",
        "        - Do not answer complex questions directly in free text\n",
        "          if an appropriate tool exists.\n",
        "        - Be robust to vague, short, or conversational user inputs.\n",
        "        - Think first, then act through tools.\n",
        "\n",

            "Primary Root Causes:\n",
            "- Demand for TechGadget Pro during the promotion far exceeded forecasted levels, leading to insufficient stock.\n",
            "- Supply chain disruptions caused a 2-day delay in replenishment shipments from the central warehouse to stores.\n",
            "- Inventory management systems showed failures in accurately tracking stock levels and reorder points, with shrinkage and damage adjustments recorded.\n",
            "- Distribution centers delayed shipments despite adequate warehouse stock, indicating prioritization or processing bottlenecks.\n",

            "- Sales volumes spiked 8-12 times above pre-promotion daily averages across all stores.\n",
            "- Central warehouse received a large stock shipment before the promotion but delayed store shipments.\n",
            "- Multiple inventory adjustments highlighted shrinkage and damaged goods reducing sellable stock.\n",
            "- Emergency stock transfers between stores occurred to mitigate localized shortages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Contributing Factors:\n",
            "- Successful promotional marketing increased customer footfall and accelerated product depletion.\n",
            "- Reactive emergency replenishments and stock transfers indicated challenges in initial stock allocation.\n",
            "- Inventory losses due to shrinkage and damage further strained available merchandise.\n",
